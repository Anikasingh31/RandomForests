Introduction to Random Forests
Random Forests is an ensemble learning method for classification, regression, and other tasks that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees during training. It outputs the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.

How Random Forests Work
Data Sampling: Random Forests use a technique called bootstrap aggregating (bagging). It involves creating multiple subsets of the original dataset with replacement.

Training Multiple Trees: Each subset is used to train a decision tree. These trees are grown to their maximum depth without pruning.

Random Feature Selection: At each split in the tree, a random subset of features is selected. This helps in making the trees less correlated.

Making Predictions:

For classification, each tree votes for a class, and the class with the most votes is selected.
For regression, the average of all tree predictions is taken.
Advantages of Random Forests
Robustness: They are less prone to overfitting compared to individual decision trees.
Versatility: Can be used for both classification and regression tasks.
Feature Importance: Provide insights into the importance of features in the dataset.
